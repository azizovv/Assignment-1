IN my Assignament I used the lecture notes to complete the assignament and also by reaserching I got some ideas.First step: I sketched the design on a paper and I added some ideas for example: the radar and the clock.

 I got the spaceship idea by looking on the youtube videos and pictures. In addition I added the sounds for the radar,clock,plantes and a conversation between two guys.
